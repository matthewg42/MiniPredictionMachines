Security
========
1. Requests need to include a Unix UTC timestamp parameter called "now" set to
   the current time.
2. Requests need to include a parameter called "pubkey" containing the API
   public key. Note: do not include the private key.
3. Requests need to include a parameter called "hmac". The value should be a
   SHA256 hash of all of the other parameters in alphabetical ascending order
   being sent in the request (including "pubkey", "now" and any other parameter
   for the given method).

API
===

Register
--------
Method: GET
Description:
  Registers an account for a mini-machine on the server.
URL Structure: 
  /register?now=[now]&pubkey=[pubkey]&did=[did]&dkey=[dkey]&hmac=[hmac]
Parameters:
  now: As above
  pubkey: As above
  did: Unique device ID
  dkey: A device key (password), I suggest that each device randomly generates
        a key of around 10 characters when it starts up. This key should
        be used in subsequent requests to authenticate the device. I think this
        is necessary because each mini-machine will be sharing the same
        public/private key pair.
  hmac: As above
Response: text/plain
  Response code 200 on success with an empty body, error response codes will
  contain a body with an error message in plain text.
     

Get Current Message
-------------------
Method: GET
Description:
  Gets the current message for the mini-machine to display.
URL Structure:
  /current_message?now=[now]&pubkey=[pubkey]&did=[did]&dkey=[dkey]&hmac=[hmac]
Parameters:
  now: As above
  pubkey: As above
  did: As above
  dkey: As above
  hmac: As above
Response: application/json
  {
    message: [string], // The message to display
    expiry: [integer] // Unix timestamp (UTC) that the message should expire on
  }


Send Data
---------
Method: POST
Description:
  Bulk upload of sensor readings to the server.
URL Structure:
  /upload
Body: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  now=[now]&pubkey=[pubkey]&did=[did]&dkey=[dkey]&hmac=[hmac]&data=[data]
Parameters:
  now: As above
  pubkey: As above
  did: As above
  dkey: As above
  hmac: As above
  data: Base64 encoded JSON according to the following structure
          {
            "measurement_type": [[utc_timestamp, "value"], ...],
            ...
          }
        where: 
          measurement_type is the type of sensor reading, e.g. temperature,
            we'll need to define a list of these.
          utc_timestamp is a Unix timestamp.
          value is the value of the reading.
       e.g.
         {
           "temperature": [ [100, "20"], [200, "21"] ],
           "rainfall": [ [101, "200"], [102, "200"], [103, "201"] ]
         }
