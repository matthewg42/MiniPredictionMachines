Security
========
1. Requests need to include a Unix UTC timestamp parameter called "now" set to
   the current time. The server allows for 5 minutes grace on either side
   of the current time to allow for clock differences.
2. Requests need to include a parameter called "pubkey" containing the API
   public key. Note: do not include the private key.
3. Requests need to include a parameter called "hmac". The value should be a
   SHA256 hash of all of the other parameters in alphabetical ascending order
   being sent in the request (including "pubkey", "now" and any other
   parameter. The general algorithm is:
     a. Sort the list of parameter values alphabetically.
     b. For each value pair append an '&' character.
     c. Join all the values together.
     d. Calculate the HMAC on that string.

Dates/Times
===========
The API provides/expects times to be in UTC.

Get Current Message
-------------------
Method: GET
Description:
  Gets the current message for the mini-machine to display.
URL Structure:
  /current_message?now=[now]&pubkey=[pubkey]&did=[did]&hmac=[hmac]
Parameters:
  now: As above
  pubkey: As above
  did: Device ID
  hmac: As above
HMAC Computation:
    HMAC of did=[did]&now=[now]&pubkey=[pubkey]
Response: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
  [timestamp]|[message]
  where:
    timestamp = Unix timestamp
    message = ASCII string with line-breaks converted to the pipe symbol (|)
  e.g:
  1499875978|This message has a|line break
  An empty body is returned if there is no current message.

cURL Example:
  curl "http://future.thepredictionmachine.org/wp-content/plugins/
  the-future-machine/api/v1/current_message?now=1499359832&pubkey=
  51655f7983&did=dominic&hmac=
